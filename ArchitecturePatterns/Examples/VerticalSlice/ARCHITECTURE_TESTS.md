# RestaurantManagement.Api.ArchTests

## Project Summary

This architecture test project enforces vertical slice architecture patterns and maintains code quality for the Restaurant Management API. It uses **NetArchTest.Rules** and **NUnit** to create executable architecture documentation and automated quality gates.

## Key Features

### ✅ Comprehensive Architecture Testing

- **31 architectural rules** covering dependencies, design patterns, naming conventions, and structure
- **100% compliance rate** with current implementation
- **Automated enforcement** through CI/CD integration

### ✅ Vertical Slice Architecture Validation

- Features are completely isolated from each other
- Each feature contains all necessary components (Endpoint, Handler, Query/Command, Response, Validator)
- Proper dependency direction (Features → Common/Data/Entities)
- CQRS pattern compliance with MediatR

### ✅ Design Pattern Enforcement

- **MediatR patterns**: IRequestHandler<,>, IRequest<> implementations
- **CQRS patterns**: Clear separation of queries and commands
- **FluentValidation**: Consistent validation approach
- **Minimal APIs**: Static endpoint classes with proper mapping methods
- **Immutable objects**: Records for queries, commands, DTOs, and responses

### ✅ Naming Convention Standards

- Consistent suffixes: Handler, Endpoint, Query, Command, Request, Response, Validator, Dto
- Operation-based prefixes matching folder structure
- Clear identification of component types

### ✅ Structural Integrity

- Complete feature implementations (no empty operations)
- Matching handler-request relationships
- No type sharing between features
- Proper namespace organization

## Test Categories

| Category | Tests | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Dependency** | 5 tests | Enforce proper dependency management and isolation |
| **Design Patterns** | 10 tests | Ensure CQRS, MediatR, and clean architecture compliance |
| **Naming** | 8 tests | Maintain consistent naming conventions |
| **Structure** | 7 tests | Verify vertical slice integrity |
| **Meta** | 1 test | Comprehensive architecture compliance reporting |

## Benefits Delivered

### 🏗️ Architecture Integrity

- Prevents architectural drift over time
- Catches violations immediately in CI/CD
- Enforces consistent patterns across all features

### 👥 Team Productivity

- Clear guidelines for new feature development
- Executable documentation of architecture decisions
- Fast feedback loop for architectural compliance

### 🔧 Maintainability

- Isolated features are easier to modify and test
- Consistent structure reduces cognitive load
- Prevents creation of technical debt

### 📈 Scalability

- Vertical slices can be easily extracted to microservices
- Independent features support parallel development
- Clear boundaries enable team scaling

## Usage Examples

### Running All Tests

```bash
dotnet test test/RestaurantManagement.Api.ArchTests/
```

### Architecture Compliance Report

```bash
dotnet test --filter "Name~RunAllArchitectureTests"
```

### Specific Test Categories

```bash
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=DependencyArchitectureTests"
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=DesignPatternTests"
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=NamingConventionTests"
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=StructuralTests"

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Local Development

- Run tests before committing changes
- Use in IDE test runner for immediate feedback
- Architecture validation during feature development

### CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Architecture Tests
    run: dotnet test test/RestaurantManagement.Api.ArchTests/ --logger "console;verbosity=normal"
    
  - name: Architecture Compliance Report
    run: dotnet test --filter "Name~RunAllArchitectureTests" --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

### Code Reviews

- Architecture tests provide objective validation criteria
- Reduces subjective architectural discussions
- Ensures consistent quality standards

## Architecture Rules Enforced

### ✅ Dependency Rules

1. Features don't depend on each other
2. Common/Data/Entities don't depend on Features
3. Entities are completely isolated
4. No forbidden technology dependencies

### ✅ CQRS/MediatR Rules

1. All handlers implement IRequestHandler<,>
2. All queries/commands implement IRequest<>
3. Queries and commands are immutable records
4. Proper handler-request relationships

### ✅ Vertical Slice Rules

1. Each feature has complete implementation
2. No sharing of types between features
3. Consistent internal organization
4. Proper namespace structure

### ✅ Quality Rules

1. Consistent naming conventions
2. Immutable data structures
3. Static endpoint classes
4. FluentValidation patterns

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Rules (Optional)

- Performance-related constraints
- Security pattern enforcement
- API versioning compliance
- Database access patterns

### Metrics Integration

- Architecture complexity scoring
- Technical debt measurement
- Compliance trending over time

### Tool Integration
